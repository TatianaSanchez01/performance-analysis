# Project: Application Performance Analysis with cProfile, Pyinstrument, and JMeter

## Introduction

This project empowers you to analyze the performance of Python and Java applications, enabling you to identify bottlenecks and optimize their efficiency. The analysis process leverages built-in Python profiling tools (`cProfile`) and a third-party library (`Pyinstrument`) for Python profiling, and JMeter for load testing Java applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python3 --version` or `python --version` in your terminal.
* **Java:** Download and install Java from the official website ([https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)) if you don't have it already.
* **Pyinstrument:**  Install Pyinstrument using pip:

```bash
pip install Pyinstrument
```

* **JMeter**: Download JMeter from the Apache Software Foundation website (<https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi>).

### Project Structure

Create a project directory to organize your files. Within this directory, consider the following structure:

```bash
    project_name/
    |- python_scripts/  # Contains your Python scripts
    |- java_applications/  # Contains your Java applications (if applicable)
    |- profiling_data/  # To store profiling results (optional)
    |- readme.md       # This file
    |- ...              # Other project-specific files
```

### Python Application Profiling

#### cProfile

1. Import and run cProfile directly within your Python scripts:

```python
import cProfile

def your_function():
    # Your code here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cProfile.run('your_function()')
```

This will generate a profiling report to the console, showing the time spent executing different parts of your code.

#### Pyinstrument

Profile specific code sections using the @pyinstrument.line_profiler decorator:

``` python
import pyinstrument

@pyinstrument.line_profiler
def your_function():
    # Your code here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    your_function()
```

Pyinstrument offers various profiling options and visualizations. Refer to its documentation for detailed usage.

### Java Application Load Testing with JMeter

#### Create a JMeter Test Plan

1. Open JMeter and create a new Test Plan.

#### Add HTTP Request Element

2. Right-click on "Test Plan" and select "Add" -> "Threads" -> "Thread Group".
3. In the Thread Group element, define the number of concurrent requests you want to simulate.
4. Right-click on "Thread Group" and select "Add" -> "Sampler" -> "HTTP Request".
5. Configure the HTTP Request element:

* Server Name or IP: Specify the server address of your Java application.
* Port: Set the port on which your application listens (e.g., 8080).
* Path: Enter the URL path for the specific functionality you want to test.

#### Add Listeners

6. Right-click on "Thread Group" and select "Add" -> "Listener" -> "Summary Report".
7. (Optional) Add other listeners like "View Results Tree" or "Aggregate Graph" for more detailed insights.

#### Run the Test

8. Click the green "play" button on the toolbar to execute the test plan.

#### Analyze Results

9. The Summary Report listener displays overall statistics like response times, throughput, and error rates.
10. Other listeners may provide more granular data for further analysis.

### New Relic Setup and Monitoring

#### Install New Relic Agent

1. Select the Operating System

* Log in to your New Relic account.
* Navigate to the "Add more data" section.
* Select your operating system from the provided options.

2. Get the License Key

* New Relic will provide a unique license key for your account. Note this key as it will be needed during installation.

3.Install the New Relic Agent

* New Relic will provide a command specific to your operating system to install the agent. Copy this command.
* Execute the command in your terminal to install the New Relic agent.

4. Verify Installation

* Once the installation is successful, you can verify it by checking the New Relic dashboard for incoming data.

#### Analyze Data in New Relic

1. Access Logs

* Go to the "Logs" section in the sidebar of the New Relic web interface to analyze the data collected by the agent.

2. Select a Project for Analysis

* You can select a specific project or application from any language supported by New Relic to monitor and analyze performance metrics.
